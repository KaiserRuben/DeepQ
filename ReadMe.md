| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture where different files are organized based on their functionalities. It utilizes the Vue.js framework along with Ionic for building cross-platform applications. The architecture seems to be mainly based on the single-page application (SPA) concept where the UI components are built using Vue.js and Ionic components. The codebase also integrates with Capacitor, allowing the application to be built as a native iOS or Android app. The overall architecture is well-structured and follows best practices for Vue.js and Ionic development.                                                                                                                                            |
| **üìñ Documentation**    | The codebase includes some comments in the code files, but there is no specific documentation file or comprehensive documentation available for the project as a whole. The comments provide basic explanations of the code structure and usage of certain components, but it would be beneficial to have more detailed documentation, especially for developers who are new to the codebase. Documenting the overall architecture, key design patterns used, and providing explanations for complex code sections would greatly improve the understanding and maintainability of the project.                                                                                        |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The codebase relies on several external libraries and systems. It utilizes Vue.js as the main JavaScript framework along with Ionic for building cross-platform applications. The project also uses Vite.js as the bundler and build tool. Other dependencies include `@vitejs/plugin-vue` for Vue.js support in Vite, `@vitejs/plugin-legacy` for legacy browser support, and Capacitor for cross-platform app development. Additionally, the codebase uses OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model for generating questions and the DeepL API for translation purposes. These libraries and services greatly enhance the functionalities and capabilities of the project. |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The codebase is organized into different files based on their functionalities. Each file represents a specific component or module of the application. The use of Vue.js and Ionic allows for the creation of reusable and interchangeable components, making it easier to maintain and extend the application. The codebase follows the principle of separation of concerns, with different files handling specific tasks such as routing, UI components, configuration, and data manipulation. This modularity enhances code reusability, maintainability, and testability.                                                                                                                                  |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | The codebase includes a testing configuration file `cypress.config.ts` that sets up Cypress for end-to-end (e2e) testing. The configuration specifies the support file, test file pattern, folders for videos and screenshots, and the base URL for the tests. Cypress offers a powerful and comprehensive testing framework for e2e testing, allowing developers to write test cases to verify the functionality of the application. However, the provided codebase does not include actual test

| [index.ts](https://github.com/KaiserRuben/DeepQ/blob/main/src/router/index.ts) | This code snippet sets up the router for an Ionic/Vue application. It imports the necessary modules, defines the routes, and creates the router object. The routes include a redirect from the root path to'/de' and a dynamic route using a language parameter. The router uses web history and the base URL provided in the environment configuration. This router is then exported for use in the application. |
